    "main_message": "I am a junior front-end developer. I got acquainted with this technology at the university where I am studying now. I find this to be a very interesting way of programming. At the moment, I prefer to use Vue in my projects. I believe that I can work in a team because I play football in my free time and it helps me to improve my communication skills. I also worked in a team with my friends from the university. We have developed a site for listening to music and other interesting things. You can see this in the 'Works' tab. Also, I have experience in back-end and pygame development.",
